# Advanced Recommendation Algorithms Implementation Plan

## Objective
Enhance the movie recommendation system by implementing advanced recommendation algorithms using machine learning techniques to provide personalized and accurate movie suggestions.

## Current State
- The backend currently has a placeholder or basic recommendation route.
- No machine learning or advanced algorithms are implemented yet.

## Proposed Approach

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation
- Collect user interaction data such as:
  - Movie ratings
  - Watch history
  - Favorites and watchlists
  - Reviews and comments
- Aggregate movie metadata from TMDB API:
  - Genres, cast, crew, keywords, release dates, etc.

### 2. Algorithm Selection
- Collaborative Filtering:
  - User-based or item-based collaborative filtering using matrix factorization (e.g., SVD).
- Content-Based Filtering:
  - Use movie metadata and user preferences to recommend similar movies.
- Hybrid Approach:
  - Combine collaborative and content-based filtering for better accuracy.
- Explore deep learning models (e.g., neural collaborative filtering) for future improvements.

### 3. Model Training and Serving
- Use Python with libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for model development.
- Train models offline with periodic updates.
- Export trained models or recommendation data to be consumed by the Node.js backend.
- Alternatively, implement a microservice in Python for recommendations and communicate via REST API.

### 4. Backend Integration
- Create new endpoints in backend/routes/recommendations.js to serve recommendations from the ML model.
- Cache recommendations for performance.
- Use user authentication to provide personalized recommendations.

### 5. Frontend Integration
- Fetch recommendations from the new backend endpoints.
- Display personalized recommendations in the Recommendations component.

## Infrastructure and Tools
- Use cloud services for model training and hosting (e.g., AWS SageMaker, Google AI Platform).
- Use databases like MongoDB or Redis for storing user data and recommendation results.
- Monitor model performance and user feedback for continuous improvement.

## Timeline and Milestones
- Phase 1: Data collection and preprocessing.
- Phase 2: Implement basic collaborative and content-based filtering.
- Phase 3: Integrate models with backend and frontend.
- Phase 4: Explore deep learning and hybrid models.
- Phase 5: Deploy and monitor in production.

## Conclusion
Implementing advanced recommendation algorithms will significantly improve user experience by providing relevant and personalized movie suggestions. This plan outlines a scalable and modular approach to achieve this goal.
